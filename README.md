# Livable Nations for Freedom-loving Technophiles
The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of those nations which would provide near-ideal living to those who:
* are moderate to heavy consumers of electronics and web content
* strongly value freedom of speech and expression
* desire an overall high standard of living at reasonable expense

Work on this document began January 31st, 2015. At the time of writing, any and all information is likely a summarization of Wikipedia articles. If a section is blank, that means I haven't gotten to it yet...
