\begin{abstract}


The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of those nations which would provide near-ideal living to those who:

\begin{itemize}
\item are moderate to heavy consumers of electronics and web content
\item strongly value freedom of speech and expression
\item desire an overall high standard of living at reasonable expense
\end{itemize}


Work on this document began January 31st, 2015. At the time of writing, any and all information is likely a summarization of Wikipedia articles. If a section is blank, that means I haven't gotten to it yet...
